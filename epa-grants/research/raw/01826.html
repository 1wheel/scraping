        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>The focus of research this year in this project is on the fundamental transformations of trace element species during coal combustion (Program Area l), with a heavy emphasis on mercury interactions with ash particulate and chlorine. Bench- and pilot-scale combustion testing and advanced sampling and analytical techniques (Program Area 2) were used for experimental studies. Many of the mechanisms of trace element transformation apply to other conversion and combustion systems such as gasifiers and waste incinerators. The information generated is being logged into the CATM Database (Program Area 4), and the experimental data are also being compared with predictive modeling of the formation of mercury and other trace element species in combustion environments. Trace element speciation results are being applied to the development of sorbents and control technologies (Program Area 3) [ 1,2]. Results of this research on mercury interactions with five gas particulate and gaseous chlorine species were presented at the CATM Fourth Annual meeting and will be presented in the 1998 Air and Waste Management Association conference in San Diego.
<P>The primary goal is to examine the fundamental trace metal transformation 
mechanisms that occur during fuel conversion. The main objectives for this 
year's work are as follows:</P>
<P>
<LI><EM>Trace metal modes of occurrence in coal. </EM>Collaborative research on 
the mode of occurrence of (species, form, mineral associations) trace elements 
in coal is being performed in conjunction with a team of international 
laboratories.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<LI><EM>Fuel and process impacts on mercury speciation and partitioning. </EM>A 
focused study of the interactions of Hg with flue gas particulate and chlorine 
gas species and impacts on Hg speciation is being accomplished in this year's 
work.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<LI><EM>Model predictions of trace element partitioning. </EM>A model formulated 
under other project work at the EERC for prediction of gasification trace 
element partitioning by vapor and particulate association is being refined and 
tested for applications in combustion systems.</LI>
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Approach:</h3>
        <p>Trace element mode of occurrence in an Illinois No. 6 coal is being 
identified using a combination of direct and indirect analytical techniques for 
determining the trace element forms and associations. Scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) and wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) were used to 
selectively examine mineral grains in the coal. Float-sink fractions of ground 
coal were analyzed using standard chemistry analytical techniques such as atomic 
absorption spectroscopy (MS) and x-ray fluorescence (XRF). The WDS analysis gave 
direct association of mineral-bound trace elements and the float-sink analysis 
gave more of a general inorganic or organic/fine mineral differentiation.</P>
<P>Mercury speciation tests were performed using a subbituminous PRB Absaloka 
coal (0.052 +- 0.005 ppm Hg, 50 +- 10 ppm Cl) that was burned at an excess 
O<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) of 8.5 mol%, while 50- and 100-ppmv HCl(g) 
were injected into the furnace at 1330?C. Apparently, the flue gas and/or fly 
ash produced from Absaloka coal combustion possess intrinsic properties that 
promote Hg-fly ash sorption. Absaloka was also known to have a history of 
producing more elemental Hg as a vapor compared to oxidized Hg vapor forms. A 
simple heated oxygen-nitrogen gas mixture with injections of gaseous elemental 
Hg and HCl was also employed to check the impacts of the reactor alone on Hg 
speciation. Hg and Cl speciation analyses of the resulting flue gases were 
performed at 200? or 250?C using the Radian International method for multimetals 
collection and Hg speciation. An on-line Hg analyzer was employed to check the 
transformation of Hg. Baghouse fly ash was also sampled and analyzed for Hg and 
chlorine bulk quantities. X-ray diffraction analysis of fly ashes were conducted 
to identify crystalline ash components using methods described by McCarthy and 
Solem [3]</P>
<P>Combustion testing using an Illinois No. 6 coal, for which other 
collaborating data are abundantly available, produced flue gas particulate and 
vapor trace element species that were partitioned by size and analyzed for trace 
element concentrations. The data will be compared to predictive modeling results 
using a modified model called TraceTran. The TraceTran model that already exists 
at the EERC for gasification systems predicts trace element concentrations as 
vapor and as particulate forms in various size fractions.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Progress</EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Trace Element Mode of Occurrence Studies</STRONG></P>
<P>A collaborative research effort is under way between the EERC, the USGS, the 
University of Kentucky, the University of Sheffield (United Kingdom), Imperial 
College (United Kingdom), CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research 
Organization, Australia), BGS, CSIC (Spain), and the Geological Survey of Canada 
to determine the mode of occurrence of Hg, Se, As, Cd, Pb, Cu, Ni, Sb, Cr, and 
Zn. It is up to the collaborating laboratory to devise analytical methods 
determining the modes of occurrence. SEM-WDS analysis of Illinois No. 6 coal 
shows relative high concentrations of Hg, Ni, Cu, Se, and As in pyrite grains in 
the coal. Antimony and Cr show pyrite associations as well, but to lesser 
degrees, and they show some associations with clay and quartz particles. Sink 
fractions show enrichments of trace elements that have typical sulfide or clay 
associations. Chemical fractionation work is now being performed to determine 
organic associations of trace elements.</P>
<P><STRONG>Process Impacts on Mercury Speciation</STRONG></P>
<P>The primary goal of this investigation was to determine whether chlorination 
is a dominant Hg transformation mechanism in a real coal combustion flue gas. A 
secondary goal was to identify the flue gas components and mechanisms 
accountable for the apparently enhanced Hg sorption characteristics of Absaloka 
coal fly ash.</P>
<P><STRONG>Spike Testing Using Hg'(g) and HCl(g)</STRONG></P>
<P>The spiking of 10 &micro;g/m<SUP><FONT size=-1>3</FONT></SUP> Hg<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g) into a simple gas mixture of 8.5 mol% O<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>2</FONT></SUB> and 91.5 mol% N<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB> 
indicated that about 50% of the Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g) spike was 
transformed to Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>2+</FONT></SUP>X(g) (see figure below). 
On-line analyzers indicated that the only gaseous components available to react 
with Hg<SUP>0</SUP>(g) were 8.5 mol% O<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB> and 30 
ppmv NO,. Kinetic limitations preclude any significant homogeneous Hg<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g)-O<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) or 
Hg<SUP>0</SUP>(g)-NO<SUB>x </SUB>(g) reactions to account for the formation of 
Hg<SUP>2+</SUP>X(g) [4-71. The formation of Hg<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>2+</FONT></SUP>X(g) must, therefore, involve a heterogeneous or 
catalytic reaction on ceramic or refractory surfaces in the CEPS. Possible 
reaction products in the Hg-NO<SUB><FONT size=-1>x</FONT></SUB> system include 
Hg nitrite and nitrate compounds, but they are generally unstable at flue gas 
temperatures, &gt;200?C, upstream of the sampling location [S, 93. 
Alternatively, the oxidation of Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g) could 
involve a heterogeneous reaction with adsorbed (ads) Hg<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>0</FONT></SUP> or O<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB> on surfaces or a 
catalyzed Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g)-0<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) reaction resulting in Hg0(g) (decomposes at 500?C) as 
the reaction product. The most plausible reaction is: </P>
<P>Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g,ads) + ?O<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g,ads) ---&gt; Hg0(g) (Reaction 1)</P>
<P>The formation of Hg0(g) occurs within a temperature range corresponding to 
the flue gas sampling and Hg0(g) decomposition temperatures, i.e., 200? to 
500?C. These temperature conditions exist over a 1.85-m refractory-lined section 
of the CEPS upstream of the sampling location. Flue gas residence time in this 
section is estimated to be &lt;0.1 s. Hall and others [4] experimentally 
investigated the heterogeneous reaction of Hg<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g) with O<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) in the 
presence of activated C and fly ash at 20? to 700?C. They concluded that 
Reaction 1 was not an important heterogeneous reaction because of kinetic 
limitations and the relatively short residence time in a flue gas duct. An 
alternative explanation is that Reaction 1 is catalyzed by a component of the 
refractory used in the combustor. A detailed chemical and mineralogical 
characterization of refractory from the baghouse-inlet sampling port indicates 
that corundum (Al<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>O<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>3</FONT></SUB>), mullite (Al<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>6</FONT></SUB>Si<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>O<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>13</FONT></SUB> ), dicalcium silicate (Ca<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>SiO<SUB><FONT size=-1>4</FONT></SUB> ), anhydrite 
(CaSO<SUB><FONT size=-1>4</FONT></SUB> ), and r-utile (TiO<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>) compose the refractory. The CaSO<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>4</FONT></SUB>, component is actually present as an irregular white 
coating on the refractory surface and is not an essential refractory component. 
Al<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>0<SUB><FONT size=-1>3</FONT></SUB> and 
TiO<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB> are known catalysts; however, additional 
laboratory-scale tests are required to evaluate whether any of these refractory 
components can catalyze Reaction 1.</P>
<P>Poor recoveries of Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g) during the 
10-&micro;g/m<SUP><FONT size=-1>3</FONT></SUP> Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g) 
+ 100-ppmv HCl spike test (see figure on page 22) provide indirect evidence for 
the formation of HgCl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(s,l) (melting point 
276?C, boiling point 302?C). Apparently, the formation of HgCl<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(s,l) involves Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g) as a 
reactant and not Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>2+</FONT></SUP>X(g) (where X is suspected 
to be O<SUP><FONT size=-1>2-</FONT></SUP>). Cl speciation results, presented in 
the figure at the top of the next page, indicate that 7 ppmv of Cl,(g) was 
available in the gas stream to react homogeneously with Hg<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g). Metals such as Al<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>0<SUB><FONT size=-1>3</FONT></SUB> are available in the 
CEPS to catalyze Cl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) formation (Reaction l), 
as indicated by XRD analysis of the refractory. Poor HCl(g) spike recoveries 
also suggest that Cl was available on surfaces within the combustor to react 
heterogeneously with Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g).</P>
<P><STRONG>Absaloka Coal - HCl(g) Spike Tests</STRONG></P>
<P>The Absaloka coal had 7.9 wt% ash and 0.57 wt% sulfur on an as-received basis 
and 0.52 ppm Hg and 50 ppm chlorine on a dry basis. Hg speciation results for 
the baseline Absaloka coal test, shown in the figure at the bottom of the next 
page, are very similar to results obtained from burning the pulverized Absaloka 
coal in a much larger pilot-scale (580-MJ/hr) combustion system and measuring Hg 
speciation using several different methods. Hg speciation results are similar 
despite the fact that pilot-scale testing was performed at a much lower excess 
O<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) concentration of 4 mol%. This suggests 
that excess O<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) concentration does not 
significantly affect the Hg speciation of Absaloka coal combustion flue gas. 
Test results from both combustion systems indicate that Absaloka coal combustion 
flue gas and/or entrained fly ash possess intrinsic properties which promote Hg 
sorption as evidenced by relatively high proportions of Hg(p).</P>
<P>As seen in the following table, a significant depletion in Hg(p), resulting 
in a relatively low Hg mass balance closure, provides indirect evidence for the 
formation of HgCl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(s,l) during the Absaloka coal 
+ 100 ppmv-HCl spike test. Chlorine speciation measurements revealed that 
Cl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) was not detected for the Absaloka 
coal-HCl(g) spike tests. The presence of H<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>O(g) 
and SO<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) apparently inhibited the formation of 
Cl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g). Therefore, the formation of HgCl,(s,l) 
would have to involve HCl(g) or Cl(p) as a reactant. Hg(p) may have reacted 
heterogeneously with HCl(g) to form HgCl,(s,l) which was then deposited on 
surfaces within the combustor. This reaction mechanism results in the desorption 
of Hg(p), implying that Hg is loosely bound to the ash. Alternatively, the 
presence of HCl(g) may have inhibited Hg-ash sorption and thus the formation of 
Hg(p). The formation of HgCl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(s,l) would then 
involve a homogeneous Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g)-HCl(g) or 
heterogeneous Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g)-Cl(p) reaction. Test 
results, however, are inconclusive for deciphering the reaction mechanism(s) 
responsible for the apparent formation of HgCl<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(s,l).</P>
<P>Chlorine analyses of the flue gas and collected fly ash (see figures on page 
26), indicate that the injected HCl(g) is scavenged by fly ash. The lack of a 
positive correlation between Cl and Hg in the bottom figure on page 26 
indicates, however, that the Cl retained on fly ash does not create active Cl 
sites for Hg chemisorption. In addition, the combination of high Cl and unburned 
C content of the ash produced during the 1 00-ppmv HCl(g) spike test (bottom 
figure on page 26 and figure on page 27, respectively) did not promote Hg(p) 
formation. Components other than chlorinated ash and C particles must promote 
the formation of Hg(p) in Absaloka coal fly ash. XRD analyses of baghouse ash 
samples were conducted to identify crystalline components that may account for 
the observed Hg(p)-HCl(g) interaction characteristics. Fly ash produced from 
Absaloka coal contains lime (CaO) and the CaO-acid gas reaction product 
CaSO<SUB><FONT size=-1>4</FONT></SUB>, as major crystalline phases. Automated 
SEM analyses by Galbreath and others [l0] indicate that CaO(s) is generally a 
major component of the fine ash fractions (&lt;2 &micro;m in diameter) of PRB 
subbituminous coal fly ashes. CaO(s) and portlandite (Ca[OH]<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>[s]), a hydration product of CaO(s), are effective 
HgCl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) and HCl(g) sorbents [1l-l3]. In 
bench-scale experiments, Ghorishi and Gullett [13] found that the presence of 
HCl(g) inhibits the adsorption of HgCl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) by 
Ca(OH)<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(s). They hypothesized that this 
inhibition effect was a result of reactive competition for the available 
alkaline sites. The inverse relationship between Hg(p) and Cl(p) documented in 
this investigation is consistent with the hypothesis of Ghorishi and Gullett 
[13], thus implying that CaO(s) is an important Hg-sorption component of 
Absaloka fly ash.</P>
<P><STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG></P>
<P>The injection of 10 &micro;g/m<SUP><FONT size=-1>3</FONT></SUP> Hg<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g) into a simple heated gas mixture (8.5 mol% 0<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>, 91.5 mol% N<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>) indicated 
that as the gas cooled for approximately 2.5 s from 1250?C to 200?C about 50% of 
the Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g) spike was transformed to Hg<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>2+</FONT></SUP>X(g), where X is most likely O<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>2-</FONT></SUP>. The formation of Hg0(g), however, is kinetically 
inhibited at the relatively short residence time available in the combustor 
[4,6,7]. A catalyzed Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g)-O<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) reaction involving a refractory metal oxide compound 
is proposed to explain the apparent formation of Hg0(g). Low recoveries of 
Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g) during 100-ppmv HCl(g) spike tests into 
the gas mixture suggest that HgCl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(s,l) was 
formed and deposited in the combustor. Cl speciation measurements indicate that 
Cl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g), an active Hg chlorinating agent, was 
available to react homogeneously with Hg<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g).</P>
<P>Combustion testing of a low-Cl (50 ? 10 ppm) Absaloka subbituminous coal at 
8.5 mol% excess O<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) indicated that on average 
41%, 19%, and 40% of the total Hg (5.5 ? 0.6 &micro;g/m<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>3</FONT></SUP>) in 250?C flue gas was present as Hg(p), Hg<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>2+</FONT></SUP>X(g), and Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g), 
respectively. These results are consistent with the relatively high Hg(p) 
concentrations noted in a much larger-scale 580-MJ/hr combustion system [2], 
thus corroborating the enhanced Hg sorption capacity of Absaloka coal fly ash. 
50- and 100-ppmv HCl(g) spike tests indicate that the Hg sorption capacity of 
Absaloka coal fly ash is adversely affected by HCl(g), even though Cl is 
scavenged by ash particles to form Cl(p). Cl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) 
was not detected in the coal combustion flue gas, possibly because of the 
inhibition effect of H<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>O(g) and SO<SUB><FONT 
size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g). The inverse relationship between Hg(p) and Cl(p) 
documented in this investigation is analogous to the inhibition effect of HCl(g) 
on the HgCl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>(g) sorption capacity of CaO-based 
sorbents [13]. The identification of CaO(s) as a dominant ash component and 
similarities in Hg-Cl-CaO and Hg-Cl-fly ash interactions suggest that CaO(s) is 
an important Hg-sorption component of Absaloka fly ash. Additional tests are 
required to confirm this hypothesis and determine whether it applies to other 
PRB subbituminous coals. </P>
<P><STRONG>Trace Element Transformation Modeling</STRONG></P>
<P>The CEPS system was set up and configured to run Illinois No. 6 combustion 
tests with triplicate sampling of flue gas particulate and trace element forms 
using a five-stage multicyclone fly ash sampler and Ontario Hydro multimetals 
sampling train. The tests were performed flawlessly, and the ash and impinger 
samples were analyzed for Hg, Se, Pb, Ni, Cd, and Cr using conventional AAS 
techniques.</P>
<P>TraceTran is an EERC model that predicts the concentrations of trace elements 
in specific particulate size categories and in the vapor phase. The model has 
been adapted and modified for coal combustion systems, and the algorithms for 
predicting trace element concentrations in the combustion ash from coal mineral 
and trace element input data will be verified and calibrated using the Illinois 
No. 6-CEPS combustion trace element partitioning data. The results from this 
work were not yet available for this report.
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Rationale:</h3>
        <P>The form and quantity of trace elements emitted from a fuel energy conversion 
system are a function of the trace element concentrations, forms, and 
associations in the fuel; the conversion</P>
<P>process; and operating conditions. Trace element modes of occurrence have a 
great bearing on coal-cleaning effectiveness and possibly on the overall 
combustion transformation mechanisms for certain elements. Arsenic that is 
associated with an arsenopyrite mineral in a coal pyrite grain may react and 
transform in its environment differently from arsenic associated with a clay 
minerals as an accessory. Several elements are being considered in an 
international study of trace element modes of occurrence.</P>
<P>The main focus of research this year was in the area of process impacts on Hg 
speciation. The speciation of Hg is an important factor to consider in 
understanding its final fate when emitted from a power plant stack, since 
control options and transport models for Hg rely heavily on its form or species. 
Chlorine and ash particulate, which are common flue gas constituents in coal 
combustion flue gas, can have profound impacts on Hg speciation. Hg exists 
primarily as gaseous elemental species, Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g), 
and as gaseous or solid inorganic mercuric compounds, Hg<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>2+</FONT></SUP>X (where X is Cl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>[g], 
SO<SUB><FONT size=-1>4</FONT></SUB>[s], O[s,g], etc.), in coal combustion flue 
gas. Hg emissions from coal-fired electric utility boilers can be generally 
classified into three main forms: particle-associated mercury, Hg(p); gaseous 
divalent mercury, Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>2+</FONT></SUP>X(g); and gaseous 
elemental mercury, Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>0</FONT></SUP>(g). Gaseous mercuric 
chloride (HgCl<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>[g]) is generally considered to 
be the dominant Hg<SUP><FONT size=-1>2+</FONT></SUP>X(g) form based on 
theoretical and experimental investigations of Hg speciation in coal and waste 
combustion flue gases. </P>
<P>Accurate prediction of Hg speciation and partitioning of other common trace 
elements is needed for devising air toxic emission control strategies, which are 
currently under consideration by EPA. Models are being devised in this program 
to predict particulate and gaseous trace element emissions during combustion.
