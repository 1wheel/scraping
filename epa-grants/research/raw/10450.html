        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>
	COTC activities are vital to our Community-University partnership. The COTC permits Center scientists and community partners to communicate study findings in a culturally-appropriate manner, to raise awareness of children&rsquo;s environmental health within and beyond the Salinas Valley, and to mobilize groups toward actions that will improve the health of low-income Latino residents in Monterey County. The specific aims for the COTC remain unchanged.</p>


        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Approach:</h3>
        

<p><STRONG>Note:  This report covers the project period   8/1/2010-5/31/2011</STRONG> </p>
<ol>
	<li><em><strong>To disseminate Center   research findings to study participants, the Salinas Valley community, and other   stakeholders.</EM></strong><br />
Over the past year, we have conducted several activities to achieve this aim:
          <ul>
            <li><STRONG>Community forum: </STRONG>Our annual   community forum to disseminate new research findings to study participants was   held on December 4, 2010. As part of the third Center grant, we are now   including the participating children, as well as their parents, in our forum to   return study results. The theme of this year&rsquo;s forum was puberty, reflecting our   current study activities and the age of our participants. Presentations for the   CHAMACOS child participants included an age-appropriate discussion of puberty   presented by health educators from Planned Parenthood.</li>
            <li><STRONG>Newsletter: </STRONG>In addition to   presenting results at the community forum, we also developed and disseminated   our annual Center newsletter to participants, community partners, and other   stakeholders in the community focusing on study results from the last year. The   newsletter also included educational information on puberty, dental health,   methyl iodide exposure, manganese exposure, and upcoming COTC activities for   children participating in the study.</li>
            <li><STRONG>Electronic Newsletter: </STRONG>We have   recently initiated an electronic newsletter for researchers and community   members to keep current with Center publications. When a new paper from the   center is published, we send out a message to our email list. Our list currently   comprises over 250 people, including researchers, students, farmworkers,   advocates, health professionals, growers, and other community members.</li>
            <li><STRONG>Dissemination to larger community and   targeted groups: </STRONG>We continued our efforts to share Center research   findings with the Salinas Valley community through targeted meetings with   community groups and key stakeholders, participation in community events, and   media interviews about our work. In the Salinas Valley, we conducted 47 meetings   with targeted groups in the community to discuss recent Center findings and   other environmental health issues. Center staff also participated in several   local health-related events such as health fairs and town hall meetings to talk   about Center research. We presented the latest scientific findings to our   Community Advisory Board, which includes representatives from the health,   agriculture, and farmworker communities, and began the process of developing an   Agricultural Council (see below). We have also worked with both English- and   Spanish-language media to disseminate our results. This spring, our publications   examining PBDE flame retardant exposure and the association of prenatal exposure   to organophosphate pesticides with IQ in 7-year-olds received local, state,   national, and international media attention. Dr. Brenda Eskenazi was interviewed   on national television (Good Morning America) and national radio programs (NPR)   while Ms. Celina Trujillo was interviewed by National Spanish television   (Univision). Hundreds of internet and print media sources also provided   coverage. In many of these interviews Drs. Eskenazi, Harley, and Bradman and Ms.   Trujillo presented research findings and suggested methods to reduce pesticide   and PBDE exposure.</li>
            <li><STRONG>Dissemination to the scientific   community: </STRONG>A list of pertinent scientific publications is listed for   each Core in their respective progress reports, along with a list of   presentations at scientific meetings. In addition, the Center hosted a quarterly   seminar series on Children&rsquo;s Environmental Health, featuring prominent   international scientists and widely advertised to Bay Area scientists. Topics   included gene-environment interaction and effects of PFOS/PFOA on onset of   puberty (see Core 2). We have also presented our findings at other local   meetings and universities, including briefings with senior scientific and   management staff at the California Department of Pesticide Regulation. We have   also hosted our yearly Science Day where all Center faculty and staff, including   Field Office staff, are updated on current research findings.</li>
            <li><STRONG>Website: </STRONG>We have recently   developed a new website: www.cerch.org. This web site will broadly present work   by the Center, including information on the CHAMACOS study, with pages for   specific audience groups including parents, families, young children and teens,   community groups, and health professionals. We are developing an online resource   center to enable access to extensive environmental health education materials   and other resources. </li>
          </ul>
	</li>
	<li><em><strong>To  increase awareness   about children&rsquo;s environmental health among low-income Latino communities,   clinicians, and service providers through widespread dissemination of innovative   outreach and educational programs.</EM></strong><br>
          <UL>
            <LI><STRONG>Outreach to pregnant women: </STRONG>In   the past, we developed the Prenatal Environmental Health Kiosk to educate   low-income Latina pregnant women about environmental health during pregnancy and   the early childhood period. We have converted the software that was previously   only available on a Macintosh platform to both PC and web formats, which will   facilitate wider dissemination. The prenatal kiosk is currently available on the   following website (chamacos.nne.net) and will be included in the new CERCH   website.</LI>
            <LI><STRONG>Outreach to childcare providers: </STRONG>In collaboration with the California Childcare Health Program (CCHP),   we continue to conduct our workshop on healthy environments in childcare   settings. We have presented seven such trainings in Alameda and Monterey   counties. Dr. Bradman also presented a workshop on environmental health in child   care for the Los Angeles Office of Education, which provides Head Start   preschool services to 28,000 children. We also worked with CCHP to publish an   Integrated Pest Management Toolkit and curriculum for California childcare   providers. See   http://www.ucsfchildcarehealth.org/html/pandr/trainingcurrmain.htm.</LI>
            <LI><STRONG>Outreach to social service organizations: </STRONG>Over the past year, Center staff has participated in monthly meetings   with our community partner, California Rural Legal Assistance, to promote   &ldquo;Healthy Homes&rdquo; principles in rural communities in California. A rural housing   quality forum is planned for October, 2011.</LI>
            <LI><STRONG>Outreach to farmworkers: </STRONG>On   February 12, 2011, we reconvened the Farmworker Council to discuss outreach   strategies, and facilitate farmworker input into Center research and health   promotion activities.</LI>
            <LI><STRONG>Outreach to growers and the agricultural   industry: </STRONG>We have also established an Agricultural Council which   includes local, state, and national organizations involved in agricultural   production, research, regulation, and marketing. We met with this group on   November 23, 2010, and will follow-up with additional meetings in June, 2011,   and beyond. Meetings to date have focused on CHAMACOS methods and results.</LI>

  <li><em><strong>To build the capacity of   Salinas Valley youth to promote healthy environmental policies in their   community.</EM></strong><br>
          <p>We established a Youth Community Council (YCC) to build youth   capacity to promote healthy environmental policies in Salinas. Youth were   recruited and selected from a local high school and the first meeting took place   in October, 2010. Since then, we have conducted 12 meetings aimed at educating   youth about environmental issues in their community and building skills to   address these issues. Strategies have included interactive discussions, games,   field trips to Center offices at UC Berkeley to learn about research, and a   &ldquo;toxics tour&rdquo; with environmental health experts in the San Francisco Bay   Area.</p>
  </li>

	<li><em><strong>To educate policy   makers at the local, state, and national levels about Center research findings   and children&rsquo;s environmental health priorities.</EM></strong><br>
		<p>We were invited to present the CHAMACOS Study findings of   pesticides and children&rsquo;s health to the Salinas City Council on two occasions   (Ms. Trujillo on January 25, 2011 and Dr. Harley on May 24, 2011). Salinas City   Council members, Gloria de la Rosa and Sergio Sanchez, and Monterey County   Supervisor, Simon Salinas, each also requested individual meetings with Center   investigators to learn more about the CHAMACOS Study research.</p>
</li>  
</ol>
		<p>Our plans over the next year include:</p>
        <UL>
            <LI><STRONG>Dissemination of Center research   findings: </STRONG>We plan to hold our annual community forum, continue targeted   outreach to community groups, and respond to invitations for presentations. We   will also continue our dissemination to the scientific community.</LI>
            <LI><STRONG>Education on children&rsquo;s environmental   health: </STRONG>Over the next year, we plan to set up the Prenatal   Environmental Health Kiosk for use in additional health clinics and social   service agencies. Environmental education to childcare providers and community   groups will continue.</LI>
            <LI><STRONG>Youth Community Council: </STRONG>Over   the summer, the YCC will work on a <EM>Photovoice</EM><EM> Project </EM>where   they will use cameras to record the positive and negative health impacts of   their local environment. After the project is complete they will present their   work to a community audience and their art will be posted in a public space. </LI>
            <LI><STRONG>Policy Makers: </STRONG>We will continue   to present our research to policy makers as requested. The Tri-County   Association of Latino Elected Officials, a regional group, has invited us to   describe the CHAMACOS studies and findings. </LI>
            <LI>The COTC core has submitted a proposal to US EPA   to expand outreach activities. </LI>
