        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>Two novel technologies for prevention and control of HAPs are being explored. The first is a precombustion process that removes trace metals, chlorine, and other HAP precursors from the fuel and/or waste prior to incineration using hydrothermal treatment. Three modes of hydrothermal treatment are being investigated during the program: subcritical water extraction, steam extraction (subcritical pressure and supercritical temperature), and supercritical water extraction. This process has a wide range of applications, including preparation of premium- rade fuels, pollution prevention in waste incinerators, treatment of contaminated soils, and processing spent sorbents. The second innovative technology involves a novel application of microorganisms in a fiber-based trickle bioreactor to remove trace metals and volatile organics from the flue gas stream. The bioreactors are novel, in that they use a polymer fiber support for the microorganisms, which improves the efficiency of removal and reduces the required quantity of cell mass required per given volume of contaminated air. In addition to proving the technical viability of these innovative techniques for preventing and controlling HAPs, a preliminary assessment of the economic viability will be performed and the results compared to commercially available alternatives.
<P>The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate the technical viability 
of two novel treatment methods to simultaneously remove air toxic metals and 
other HAPs. While the focus of the program will be on mercury, other pollutants 
that should be affected by both of these processes include lead, arsenic, 
selenium, cadmium, chlorine, fluorine, sulfur, and volatile organics. The 
general goals of the program are listed briefly below, with specific objectives 
for each task presented with the scope of work for that task. Goals are as 
follows:</P>
<P>
<LI>To demonstrate the effectiveness of hydrothermal treatment as a pretreatment 
method for controlling trace metals and chlorine from medical wastes, municipal 
solid wastes, and other waste materials while simultaneously producing an 
upgraded fuel.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<LI>To investigate the capabilities of bioreactors to remove contaminants 
(volatile metals and organic compounds) from airstreams using polymer fibers to 
support particular strains of microorganisms.
<P></P>
<P></P>
<LI>To compare cost and effectiveness of various metal emission prevention and 
control technologies that are currently being researched or used 
commercially.</LI>
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Approach:</h3>
        <p>This project comprises three discrete tasks. The first task focuses on the 
use of hydrothermal treatment as thermal washing of contaminated waste and 
fossil fuels to remove associated trace elements from the solid material. The 
second task examines the use of biofilters for the removal of volatile metals 
and organics from stacks. The third task compares the cost-effectiveness of 
these and other HAP prevention and control technologies. The specific objective 
of the Environmental Aspects of Hydrothermal Treatment task is to determine the 
amount of toxic metals and chlorine that can be removed from a variety of 
high-volume waste streams using sub- and supercritical water. Bench-scale 
extractions are being performed using a multigram apparatus capable of thermally 
treating up to 20 g of solid material at temperatures and pressures both above 
and below the critical conditions of water. Experiments consist of loading 
approximately 10 g into the tubing reactor, preheating the furnaces to selected 
conditions, and flowing water through the fixed bed for a set period of time. 
Extractions are at 250?C and 800 psi (subcritical), 400?C and 2100 psi (steam 
conditions), and 400?C and 3300 psi (supercritical conditions) for each waste or 
solid fuel. Water/steam flows through the solids for approximately 30 min at the 
specified conditions prior to depressurization and sample collection. From the 
extractions, the solid residual is analyzed to determine how much mercury, 
cadmium, lead, and chlorine were extracted from the solid to the aqueous phase. 
Water and gas samples from those tests showing good mercury removal are also 
analyzed.</P>
<P>Metal and VOC (volatile organic compound) Removal from Gas Streams by Novel 
Filter-Based Trickle-Bed Bioreactors focuses on proof of concept, rather than 
process optimization, to investigate the capabilities of bioreactors to remove 
mercury and VOCs from airstreams. As part of this, the quantities of Hg2+ and 
Hg" that the microorganisms can take up per unit cell mass and the breakthrough 
time of mercury through the bioreactor filters are being determined for use in 
preliminary full-scale reactor design. The test sequence begins with incubating 
the microorganisms and inoculating them on the biofilter. Once the filters have 
been impregnated with the biomass, the filters are placed in the trickle-bed 
bioreactor. Three filters in series will be used to facilitate the collection of 
design information. The filters will be exposed to humidified air spiked with 
Hg" and HgCl2,, a selected VOC, and HCl. The biomass is not sensitive to the 
other normal flue gas constituents [9]; therefore, to decrease the cost and 
complexity of the experiments, these will not be added to the synthetic gas 
mixture. The concentrations of trace metals and VOCs leaving the reactor will be 
measured to determine the effectiveness of the treatment method. Each of the 
biofilters will be digested and analyzed upon completion of each individual test 
to provide input for a mass balance. The experimental test matrix is designed to 
allow determination of the total amount of metals that can be adsorbed by the 
biomass and of the time-dependent removal of metals using the biofilters. </P>
<P>The goal of the economic analysis is to compare cost and effectiveness of 
various metal emission prevention and control technologies that are currently 
being researched or used commercially. Mercury control methods are the focus of 
the study. The approach has been to build models that are based on the major 
equipment costs. Fixed percentages of the equipment costs are used to calculate 
the other components of capital cost. Operating costs include raw materials and 
additional labor that are required due to the control technology. The review is 
utilizing available information in the literature, including process layouts, 
capital and operating costs, and level of control. Vendors and users are being 
contacted to get a generic technology description, costs, and levels of control. 
The cost for the two technologies being investigated in Tasks 1 and 2 and other 
EERC-developed technologies will be estimated by comparing them to existing 
technologies where data exist and/or by pricing major components to determine 
critical parameters. Sensitivity analyses are being performed to determine the 
impact of varying critical process parameters. The technologies being reviewed 
include conventional and advanced physical cleaning, hydrothermal treatment, 
activated carbon injection, fixed-bed adsorbers, flue gas condensers, and wet 
and dry scrubbing. A technology summary will be prepared for each control method 
evaluated, and the technologies will be compared in clear, concise tables and 
graphs.
<P><STRONG><EM>Progress</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>The use of hydrothermal treatment for removal of mercury and other HAPS has 
been the focus of one of the major tasks under the CATM Year 5 program. To date, 
small batch experiments have been carried out on two sewage sludges (high and 
low levels of chlorine), RDF, petroleum coke, and raw crude oil. Additional work 
has been performed on two Illinois Basin coals under the CATM JSRP with ICCI. In 
addition, oxidizing agents, including acetic acid, formic acid, and hydrogen 
peroxide, have been used for several tests.</P>
<P>Available results show that almost complete removal of both chlorine 
(&gt;99.9%) and mercury (89.6%-99.4%) can be accomplished with the sewage 
sludges. Results from the hydrothermal treatment of the high-chlorine sewage 
sludge are shown in the following table. Essentially all of the chlorine is 
removed for all processing conditions tested. Under subcritical conditions, most 
of the chlorine is transferred to the aqueous phase, while at supercritical 
conditions, almost half of the chlorine is either released in the gas phase or 
has reacted with the metal walls of the reactor. Additional work needs to be 
done to close the chlorine balance and to determine the extent of any corrosion 
that may occur at the supercritical conditions.</P>
<P>To accomplish high levels of mercury removal from the sewage sludge, 
supercritical temperature but subcritical pressure (steam) is required. In all 
three cases, a significant fraction of the mercury is released in the gas phase. 
A zeolite or carbon filter would be used in an integrated system to concentrate 
the mercury and remove it from the gas phase. Although no leaching tests have 
been performed, it is anticipated that this material would be suitable for 
disposal.</P>
<P>For the RDF case, the mercury appears to be bound rather tightly to the 
inorganic fraction and remains with the solid residue. Lead also follows this 
pattern. With the RDF, especially at the supercritical conditions, the organic 
fraction can be separated from the residual solids and could potentially be used 
as a clean-burning liquid fuel. It is speculated that the chlorine will remain 
in the water phase; therefore, the dioxin&amp;ran issue will be resolved in 
addition to the trace metals through hydrothermal treatment. For the RDF, since 
the mercury and other HAPS appear to be stable in the solid fraction even under 
the most stringent treatment conditions, the hydrothermal treatment of RDF may 
generate a solid material that can be safely disposed. </P>
<P>Extractions were performed with petroleum coke and crude oils. The premise 
behind the choice of these materials was that the hydrothermal processing 
conditions could potentially open the porphyrin groups that are the typical 
sites for vanadium, nickel, and other metals such as mercury. If these metals 
could be released from the porphyrins, then they could be extracted from the 
organic residue. Preliminary results, however, showed that hydrothermal 
processing, even at supercritical conditions, was not sufficient to remove any 
of the metals from the petroleum coke. These samples were further treated with 
H<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>O<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB>, acetic 
acid, and formic acid, in the hope that these oxidizing agents would attack the 
sites binding the metals and provide a mechanism to release them from the 
organic matrix. No significant improvement was noted in metal reduction. The 
tests with the crude oils were equally unsuccessful in removal of nickel and 
vanadium from the organic matrix.</P>
<P>Work performed under a jointly sponsored project by CATM, DOE, and ICC1 
showed that both sulfur and mercury can be reduced from bituminous coals. 
Compliant coal was produced on the bench scale from a 3.5% sulfur coal. In 
addition, the following reductions in HAPs were noted: 99% mercury, 85% arsenic, 
29% selenium, and 53% chlorine. The upgraded product had a heating value of 
14,475 Btu/lb. Solids recovery for the process was only 68%; however, the energy 
recovery was significantly higher at 93%.</P>
<P>Work on mercury removal through trickle-bed biofiltration focused primarily 
on reactor design and establishing a viable growth of microorganisms. The most 
difficult task, the design and construction of a functioning bench-scale trickle 
bed bioreactor, has been completed. The prototype is currently undergoing 
shakedown testing with few complications encountered. Construction of the 
remaining four bioreactors is under way based on the successful design and 
operation of the prototype. The first prototype reactor will be ready for 
mercury remediation trials in early February. </P>
<P>The focus of the economic evaluation has been primarily on the coal cleaning. 
The cost- effectiveness of conventional coal cleaning, froth floatation, 
selective agglomeration, and hydrothermal treatment have been preliminarily 
compared. The primary cost of coal cleaning incurred by the utility company is 
an incremental increase in the price of fuel. This can range from $2 to over $30 
per ton of coal. Coal cleaning, however, also offers a number of benefits to the 
utility in the form of lower SO<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB> emissions, 
lower operating and maintenance costs resulting from reduced ash content, and 
lower waste disposal costs. In analyzing the cost of mercury reduction using 
coal-cleaning methods, credits were given to offset these benefits. Based on the 
conservative estimates of $100/ton SO<SUB><FONT size=-1>2</FONT></SUB> reduced 
and $20/ton for waste disposal, the incremental cost of using cleaned coal for 
mercury control was estimated, with results shown in the figure above. The 
mercury removal costs are shown as a function over the typical range of 
coal-cleaning costs for each of the technologies considered. The calculations 
are based on mercury removals of 21% for conventional cleaning, 55% for froth 
floatation, 68% for selective agglomeration, and 90% for hydrothermal treatment. 
The results show that conventional coal cleaning is very cost-effective, based 
on a $/lb mercury removed. However, since conventional cleaning is only 
effective at removing low levels of mercury, it probably is not a viable method 
for mercury control. Of the advanced coal-cleaning methods, hydrothermal 
treatment shows the most promise, both in terms of achievable mercury levels and 
in cost. Mercury removal levels of 90% and greater have been demonstrated with 
Illinois Basin coal, with the incremental cost of mercury removal ranging from 
$40,000 to $84,00O/lb Hg removed. This is within the range of costs of $4920 to 
$70,000/1b Hg removed presented by EPA in its recent report to Congress as the 
projected cost of mercury control in utility applications. Future work at the 
EERC will focus on optimizing the hydrothermal treatment process and developing 
more accurate cost estimates.
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Rationale:</h3>
        <p>Environmentally sound disposal of municipal and industrial wastes has become 
a major issue in the past decade [1,2]. The volume of these wastes, including 
refuse, medical wastes, hazardous wastes, and sewage sludge has continued to 
grow annually, and traditional disposal methods (landfilling or ocean dumping) 
are becoming less acceptable because of cost and environmental concerns. 
Incineration in modern high-efficiency combustors is being employed for a 
growing fraction of waste streams to achieve significant reduction in refuse 
volume, but has been coupled with an increase in the complexity and efficiency 
of air pollution controls to limit incinerator emissions. Emission control for 
these systems, however, is more challenging than for a coal-fired plant because 
of HCl, HF, dioxin, furans, and much higher concentrations of the heavy metals 
(mercury, lead, cadmium, arsenic, chromium, nickel, and zinc) emissions from 
typical waste burning plants [3]. Consequently, precombustion technologies have 
an even greater potential for pollution control for waste-fired systems than for 
coal-fired systems. </P>
<P>The use of hydrothermal treatment has shown success at extracting sulfur and 
associated metals. Based on preliminary tests at the EERC, organically 
associated sulfur and metals have been extracted from coal using subcritical 
water; thus conditions at or above supercritical pressure may not be necessary. 
Work currently being conducted at the EERC under support from ICC1 has confirmed 
that in excess of 80% of total sulfur and up to 99% of the mercury can be 
removed using water at 400?C and 2300 psig, much below the critical pressure of 
3200 psig [4]. Other researchers have reported the beneficial extraction 
properties of subcritical water or hydrothermal treatment for organics and/or 
metals. </P>
<P>Traditional methods for air purification (adsorption, incineration, and 
catalytic combustion) have inherent disadvantages. Adsorption requires periodic 
regeneration of the adsorbent. Incineration and catalytic combustion require 
high temperatures (150?-500?C, depending on the catalyst and pollutants), and 
thermal methods do not remove metals [5]. Biological methods of air 
purification, based upon the ability of certain bacteria to degrade toxic 
organic compounds to produce carbon dioxide and water, may be considered an 
alternative to the traditional methods [6]. The ability of many microorganisms 
to adsorb metals onto their cell surface has also been observed [7]. These 
metals become a permanent part of the cell structure and are, therefore, not 
desorbed to rerelease the metal pollutant. The metals accumulate in the cell 
biomass and require periodic harvesting of the biomass for removal [7]. The 
removed metal-laden biomass can be treated for recovery of the metal. 
Preliminary experiments using polymer fibers as supports for bacterial cell 
immobilization in the trickle-bed bioreactor show removal efficiencies ranging 
from 70% to 100% for various pollutants(toluene, ethyl acetate, undecane, 
styrene, ethanol, etc.). The substrate concentrations varied from 10 to 300 
mg/m<SUP><FONT size=-1>3</FONT></SUP> and the space velocity of air from 2500 to 
20,000 hr<SUP><FONT size=-1>-1</FONT></SUP>. In other experiments, 
microorganisms were shown to accumulate metals in cell mass at concentrations 
1000-fold above the water concentration. Total amounts of metal accounted for 
l%-2% of the dry cell mass [7,8]. It is suspected that similar results will be 
possible in contaminated airstreams. </P>
<P>An estimation of the cost of these and other control technologies are needed 
as control strategies are developed. The EPA in its recent Mercury Study Report 
to Congress presented cost estimates for a variety of technologies. However, a 
more detailed economic analyses, with special emphasis on cost-sensitivity 
analysis, will help determine critical parameters to be evaluated in full-scale 
test burns, help direct research activities, allow the benefits of co-control to 
be evaluated, and allow potential cost reductions resulting from technology 
improvements to be evaluated.
