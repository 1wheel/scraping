        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>Children in America&rsquo;s cities are at risk of exposure to multiple known and potential developmental toxicants, and particular concern has been raised about newly identified, widely prevalent chemicals &ndash; the so-called endocrine disruptors (EDs), which include phthalates and alkyl phenols. They have become widely dispersed in the urban built-environment, and significant levels of phthalates are now nearly ubiquitous in the bodies of Americans. Highest exposures occur in children and in minorities. Yet little is known, either of children&rsquo;s pathways of exposure to EDs, or their presence and their levels in children, or of the human developmental toxicity of EDs. To address these gaps, the Mount Sinai Center is undertaking research (1) to characterize the levels and sources of children&rsquo;s exposures to contemporary-use EDs in the urban built environment; (2) to study relationships between EDs and neurobehavioral development; (3) to study relationships among ED exposures, diet, physical activity, and somatic growth; and (4) to characterize enzymatic polymorphisms that may modulate individual susceptibility to EDs. </p>

        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Approach:</h3>
        <p>During years 1-5 of the Center, we studied effects of exposure to environmental chemicals on children&rsquo;s growth and neurobehavioral development. We characterized children&rsquo;s exposures to pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DDT, chlordane and lead in three birth cohorts from East and Northern Harlem, New York City. We also evaluated susceptibility factors related to certain exposures. With the East Harlem community, we developed, deployed and field-tested integrated pest management methods to reduce children&rsquo; exposures to neurotoxic pesticides. In a population of African-American men whose mothers had participated in the Collaborative Perinatal Project during the 1960s, we measured in utero exposure to PCBs and found associated decrements in intelligence that were still evident at age 17 years. We are now studying timing of pubertal development. PCBs, but not DDE, were strongly associated with income, a socioeconomic status indicator, in this cohort. In two recently established (1998-2001) East Harlem birth cohorts, we found evidence for common (but not universal) exposure to organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides. Exposures to PCBs and related chlorinated hydrocarbons were quite low, but PCB levels were still associated with fish intake. In utero exposure to organophosphates was associated with decreased head circumference of infants at birth, but only in mothers with low PON1 activity. In years 6-10, we continue to follow the birth cohorts established in the first grant cycle, to evaluate effects on later childhood development of these prenatal exposures as well as the prevalent ED exposures.</p>

        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Expected Results:</h3>
        <p><strong><u>Project 1</u></strong> is a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) project that is studying childhood obesity in relation to structural features and endocrine disruptor (ED) exposures in the urban built environment of East Harlem. We are assessing accessibility to physical activity resources and to healthy foods. Quantitative physical activity is being assessed using a newly developed protocol that records daily pedometer readings and activity diaries. Children&rsquo;s usage patterns of EDs are being determined through a &ldquo;product-use&rdquo; questionnaire (developed in our CBPR). We have completed a 6-month study to evaluate biomarker protocols in 34 6-8 year-old children of phthalates, phenols, and phytoestrogens and the sources of those chemicals, with data analysis underway. Reported product usage is being compared with children&rsquo;s body burdens of new-age EDs as determined in urine. Findings will guide sample collection and analysis for both Projects 1 and 2, as well as lead to an improved product-use questionnaire. A 3-year longitudinal study has begun in 150 6-8 yr-old children to evaluate risk for obesity in relation to built environment factors and ED exposures. </p>

<p>We will continue to examine temporal variability and reliability of the EDs in order to determine optimal urine sampling strategies, to examine ED exposure levels and their relationship to diet, physical activity level and weight, and to compare availability, proximity and density of resources (GIS data) with individual level factors (Neighborhood questionnaire) such as access, knowledge, utilization, dietary quality and physical activity level. </p>

<p><strong><u>Project 2</u></strong> is a continuing prospective epidemiologic study of an ethnically diverse birth cohort of infants born at Mount Sinai. We are now conducting neurobehavioral and anthropometric assessments, including %-body fat, at the child&rsquo;s 4th, 6th, and 7th year. The aim is to assess whether <em>in utero</em> and/or childhood exposure to pesticides and endocrine disruptors, specifically organophosphates, pyrethroids, PCBs, phthalates, and <em>bis</em>phenol A, are associated with childhood growth and neurodevelopment in children in New York City. The possible modulating influences of polymorphisms and enzymatic activity involving paraoxonases, lipases, and glucuronidases will also be evaluated, in collaboration with Project 3. </p>

<p>We are finalizing the statistical analyses of birth outcomes in relationship with maternal prenatal exposure to alkylphosphate pesticide metabolites, PCBs and DDT, lead, and paraoxonase activity as well as genotypes. We have started our analysis of prenatal exposure to pesticide metabolites, PCBs and DDT, lead, and PON expression and the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment, which was given within 48 hours of delivery, and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development which were given at years 1 and 2. </p>

<p><strong><u>Project 3</u></strong> has been studying seven genetic polymorphisms in the enzymes that activate and detoxify organophosphates and other pesticides in the population of mothers and infants enrolled in Project 2. Genotype-phenotype associations of PON1 vary by allele, are independent of race/ethnicity, and are stronger for infants than mothers. Results suggest that infants may be more susceptible to toxic effects of PON1 substrates. We have developed a new robust single molecule-based haplotyping technology that was verified by showing haplotype-based variation in PON1 activity in mothers heterozygous at two loci, a result that could not have been determined by genotyping or by haplotype inference. High throughput assays for UGT2B7 and lingual lipase are under development, to address our aims to investigate these new ED-related susceptibility factors. </p>

<p>We will complete the examination inferred versus molecular paraoxonase-1 haplotypes in our population. We have found that twenty of the 137 individuals showed different molecular haplotypes than the inferred haplotypes, a 15% disconcordancy, suggesting caution in the use of statistical inference for haplotypes. When the most probable predicted diplotype had a probability of 50-65%, 14 of 31 were discordant (45%). The UGT2B7 promoters of our African-American population will be resequenced. The UGT2B7 results will be compared to exposure measurements and with outcome measurements from Project 2. </p>

<p>In addition, the lipase/amylase data will be used to select individuals with varying lipase/amylase ratios for analysis of phthalate metabolism in collaboration with Dr. Dana Barr at the CDC by HPLC-MS. Goals include establishing an inexpensive biomarker assay to permit large population studies of human variation in phthalate metabolism, and to compare these biomarker results with exposure measurements and outcome measurements from Project 2.</p>
