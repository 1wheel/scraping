        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        The goal of this project is to develop the capability to reductively dechlorinate 
  high concentrations of TCE and other chlorinated solvents to ethylene through 
  halorespiration. While TCE reductive dechlorination has been demonstrated under 
  a variety of conditions, most laboratory and field projects have been conducted 
  at TCE concentrations of 100 mg/L or less. However near NAPL sources, concentrations 
  of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons approach their solubilities (&gt;1,000 
  mg/L for TCE and &gt;150 mg/L for PCE). A consortium will be developed and characterized 
  with the ability to reductively dechlorinate high concentrations of TCE to stoichiometric 
  quantities of ethylene. By understanding the factors affecting reductive dechlorination 
  kinetics, we will be better able to optimize the process. This project will 
  prove useful for the remediation of chlorinated aliphatic compounds in the NAPL 
  source zone. 
<p><b>Objectives/Hypothesis:</b> 
<p> The specific objectives of this project are to: (1) Develop a culture with 
  the ability to reductively dechlorinate TCE to ethylene at very high concentrations 
  (above 1,000 &micro;M) and in the presence of DNAPL; (2) Characterize microbial 
  growth and measure maximum substrate utilization rates and half velocity coefficients 
  for successive dechlorinations of TCE to ethylene; (3) Characterize the microbial 
  consortium by investigating molecular methods to evaluate the diversity of the 
  mixed culture developed in the kinetic studies; (4) Provide kinetic information 
  and cultures in support of the Project - &quot;Development of the Push-Pull 
  Test to Monitor the Bioaugmentation of Dehalogenating Cultures.&quot; The goal of this project is to develop the capability to reductively dechlorinate 
  high concentrations of TCE and other chlorinated solvents to ethylene through

  (above 1,000 &micro;M) and in the presence of DNAPL; (2) Characterize microbial

  and cultures in support of the Project - &quot;Development of the Push-Pull 
  Test to Monitor the Bioaugmentation of Dehalogenating Cultures.&quot; The proposed Center will focus on the geochemical, biological, hydrological/mineralogical and engineering aspects of environmental problems associated with mining and mine wastes with the goal of developing new or improved methods or technologies that are cost effective and lead to clean ups that are protective of human health and the environment. A common theme among these environmental problems is contamination of all media (air, ground water, soil, sediments, and surface water) resulting from a host of metals, primarily As, Cd, Cu, Mn, MO, Pb, and Zn, and a wide variety of sources (e.g., acid drainage from adits and sulfide bearing waste piles, exposed ore zones, heap-leach spoils, mine waste piles and sediments, slag piles, fluvial tailings deposits, and tailings and waste rock piles).
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Approach:</h3>
        Project 1 will focus on understanding and quantifying the effects of natural organic matter (NOM) on the toxicity, bioavailability, transport and transformations of As and Se in aquatic systems. Project 2 will focus on surface water and sediment transport, with an emphasis on the fate and transport of metals in rivers from mining wastes, to develop a predictive scientific methodology for watershed rehabilitation strategies and Total Maximum Daily Loads. Project 3 will evaluate the effect of organic matter characteristic and type on organic products produced by microbial populations, on microbial population distributions, and metal speciation to improve performance of microbially active permeable reactive barriers. Project 4 will evaluate the effect of organic matter characteristic and type on organic products produced by microbial populations, on microbial population distributions, and metal speciation to characterize the recovery of a specific stream ecosystem from mining pollution.
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Rationale:</h3>
        The types of contamination and the specific processes required to address mine waste problems are identified within the structure of five focus areas: (1) site characterization and contaminant transport/transformation; (2) surface water and sediment transport; (3) treatment processes; (4) technologies; and (5) ecological and human health toxicity. Each of these focus areas is an essential component of the remediation process, and will include basic and applied research. Mathematical and physical models will be used to better understand processes and to help extend the results of the basic research to field demonstrations and applications. Training, technology transfer and outreach programs will focus on the development of new technologies; these programs will provide educational information to allow communities to make informed decisions concerning environmental contamination; and they will provide technical assistance to communities and other stakeholders with an ultimate goal of redeveloping brownfields sites.
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Expected Results:</h3>
        <p>The results of projects 1,2 and 4 will directly support risk assessments related to environmental impacts of mine waste sites through an improved understanding of the bioavailability, transport, and ecological impacts, respectively, of metals emanating from such sites. Project 3 will improve our ability to remediate these impacts based on the cleanup goals established from such risk assessments. Research, technology transfer, and outreach objectives will be achieved through multi-disciplinary teams spanning multiple institutions, linkages to existing HSRC's, and a wide variety of information transfer media.</p>
<P><b>Relevant Web Sites:</b>
<p>Collateral grants address outreach activities related to Brownfields. This 
  grant will also be the vehicle for future additional federal funds, in addition 
  to those committed for core grants, for supporting research and outreach activities 
  at the Center.
