        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <P>The proposed Northwest Research Center for Particulate Air Pollution and Health will integrate the efforts of a multi-disciplinary team of scientists with expertise in environmental exposure assessment, toxicology, epidemiology, and biostatistics, whose combined efforts will address critical aspects of the health effects related to particulate matter (PM) air pollution. The theme of this Center is combustion-derived fine particulate composition, exposures, and health effects. Atmospheric fine particulate components vary regionally as a result of climate, industry, and resources. Elucidation of relationships among ambient air quality, population exposures, and population health (and study of these regional differences as a strategic approach to uncovering causative agents and mechanisms of effect) will provide crucial information to understand and prevent PM-associated health effects.
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Approach:</h3>
        <P>The Northwest PM Center is well-positioned to advance understanding of 
population exposures to atmospheric PM and resulting health effects, by linking 
and building on the following aspects of Northwest PM activity: (1) the 
innovative programs of PM measurement in Northwest states carried out by the 
University of Washington, Washington State University and local air agencies, 
together with ongoing and anticipated enhancements such as the PM2.5 network; 
(2) the expertise and progress to date by academic and local air agencies in 
characterization of sources, atmospheric transport and transformation models, 
ambient impacts, and personal or community exposures to fine PM; (3) the 
University and affiliated resources for research in related biomedical areas 
such as toxicology, epidemiology, biostatistics and biomarkers. The Center will 
accomplish its aims by providing administrative infrastructure, research 
funding, and technical support to help focus and link studies of PM that address 
aerosol characterization for exposure assessment, population studies aimed at 
establishing the role of PM exposures in cardiopulmonary morbidity and 
mortality, and toxicological studies that seek to establish causative agents and 
physiological processes. The research projects are focused on epidemiology, 
exposure assessment, health effects, dosimetry, and toxicology. Center research 
and related research will be assisted by three resource service cores: Health, 
Exposure, and Biostatistics. These cores will each provide expertise, services, 
and resources to assist projects and to maximize the cross-project benefits of 
shared data and methods. 
<P><B>The Northwest PM Center proposes three research projects:</B> 
<P><B><I>Project 1. Epidemiology Study of Particulate Matter (PM) and 
Cardiopulmonary Mortality. (Harvey Checkoway)</I></B> 
<P>This project will consist of two related study designs addressing 
associations between ambient PM exposure and cardiorespiratory disease risks. 
The first will be a time-series analysis of cause-specific mortality in Seattle 
that relates daily mortality with changes in PM and co-pollutant levels. 
Emphasis will be placed on cardiovascular and respiratory disease mortality. In 
parallel with this analysis, we will also perform similar time-series analyses 
of mortality in Spokane, Washington and Anchorage, Alaska. The contrasts of 
results between Seattle, Spokane, and Anchorage, which have different PM 
compositions, should add significant new information about the relative 
contributions of particle count, size, and chemical composition to 
cardio-respiratory mortality. The second design will be a "case-crossover" study 
of roughly 1100 out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) cases in Seattle. 
This design compares PM levels in the days immediately preceding SCA events with 
levels at previous reference time points. Individual level data on other SCA 
risk factors including smoking, clinical history of cardiovascular diseases, and 
other morbidity, will be used to identify the most susceptible subgroups for 
PM-related SCA. Adjustments for urban/suburban and elevation gradients, and 
indoor/outdoor PM gradients will be made from data generated by related projects 
in the center. The mortality time-series and SCA case-crossover analyses will be 
performed during years 1-2 of the grant. Newly initiated projects, such as 
time-series and case-crossover studies of childhood asthma and adult COPD will 
be undertaken in years 3-5. 
<P><B><I>Project 2. Comprehensive Exposure and Health Effect Assessment in 
Susceptible Subpopulations (Jane Q Koenig, L-Jane Sally Liu, David S Covert, 
Candis Claiborn, WSU) </I></B>
<P>This project integrates personal exposure assessment, exposure 
characterization, and the study of health effects into a single research effort. 
Each of the three proposed sub-projects has a specific emphasis and set of 
objectives. The sub-projects are integrated to maximize our ability to 
comprehensively study air pollution and its association with health effects. 
Project 2a <B>(Koenig)</B> is a health effect panel study that will do 
comprehensive health monitoring of three susceptible and one healthy 
sub-populations in Seattle, Spokane, and other cities. The susceptible 
individuals proposed for study are adults who are 65 years of age or older and 
have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cardiovascular disease or 
children with asthma. The health endpoints to be measured in adult subjects are 
peak flow, pulse rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, and heart rate 
variability. The health endpoints to be measured in the children with asthma are 
pulmonary function and symptoms. Personal exposure measurements necessary for 
associating the health effects with air pollutants will be collected on study 
participants in Project 2b.<B>(Liu, Claiborn)</B>. Intensive exposure and 
dosimetry measurements among various susceptible sub-populations will be 
collected to examine the contribution of outdoor sources to personal exposures 
to PM. In addition, comprehensive exposure and dosimetry models will be 
developed to estimate personal PM exposures and doses for subjects who are not 
monitored. These measurements will be tested for associations with acute effects 
from more than 250 susceptible and healthy subjects. Project 2b includes a 
subcontract with Candis Claiborn, Washington State University, who will measure 
semi volatile organic compounds simultaneously with the indoor, outdoor, and 
personal monitoring described above. We will extensively characterize chemical 
and physical parameters of different sizes of ambient and indoor aerosols in 
simulated airway conditions in Project 2c <B>(Covert)</B>, the dosimetry 
assessment substudy. We will also be able to estimate personal exposures and 
doses for members of these sub-populations who do not have intensive exposure 
monitoring linked to their health assessment. We will further be able to test 
for acute health effects of air pollutants across the four sub-populations. We 
expect to identify specific components of PM such as mass, particle number, or 
chemical constituents, that are potentially causative agents for adverse health. 
The hypothesis tested in Project 2 is that higher exposures to PM and associated 
organic compounds from combustion prominent in the Northwestern US are 
associated with detectable differences in acute cardiorespiratory physiologic 
health measures among elderly susceptible sub-populations, and with both acute 
and chronic pulmonary function measurements and symptoms among young asthmatic 
children. The organic compounds of concern include particle-bound organic 
matter, e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the semi-volatile 
organic compounds (SVOC) that are associated with wood smoke and fossil fuel 
combustion. 
<P><B><I>Project 3. Mechanisms of Toxicity of Particulate Matter (PM) Using 
Transgenic Mouse Strains (Daniel L Luchtel) </I></B>
<P>The proposed toxicology project uses transgenic mouse strains, initially 
those selected for cardiovascular disease, as animal model(s) for exploring the 
mechanisms of PM-related acute morbidity and mortality. This model will be used 
to test the hypotheses that in compromised individuals (age, disease status), 
inhaled PM initiate production by cells in the lung of inflammatory mediators 
and oxidants, that then become bloodborne and target the cardiovascular system, 
leading to acute morbidity and mortality. Apart from use in validating and 
mechanistic studies, a susceptible mouse model will be useful in assessing 
relative potency of different ambient PM mixtures, leading to new hypotheses 
regarding causative agents. We hypothesize that inhaled PM causes release of 
inflammatory mediators from cells in the lung that become bloodborne and target 
the cardiovascular system, particularly the heart. In compromised individuals 
(age, diet, disease status), the cascade of mediators released from the lung 
acts on the cardiovascular system and causes acute morbidity and mortality. We 
will use transgenic mouse strains with specific cardiovascular genetic 
alterations to address the research need to identify potential health conditions 
that enhance susceptibility to adverse PM health effects. The nature of such 
health conditions should then provide insight into the biological mechanisms by 
which PM mediates acute and chronic health effects. 
<P>Major emphasis in Center activities aimed at collaboration and information 
exchange with other PM Centers, Supersites, and with PM researchers generally 
will be an objective of the Administrative Core <B>(Kalman)</B>. An annual cycle 
of Center-directed meetings and planning activities will continually update and 
refocus the Center research agenda. Three other resource cores will assist with 
the research; a Health Effects core <B>(Kaufman)</B> will provide consultation 
for health aspects of proposed studies; an Exposure and Dosimetry core 
<B>(Larson)</B> will serve as an air quality, exposure monitoring and chemistry 
laboratory resource for proposed studies; and a Statistics and Data resource 
core (Lumley, Sheppard) will oversee data management, data analysis, and data 
quality issues.
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Expected Results:</h3>
        <P>While several Northwest programs of research are already established in areas 
ranging from meteorology to biomarkers, this Center will provide critical 
elements to apply expertise and to leverage existing activities to address PM 
topics. Specific research project findings will lead to improved exposure 
assessment and population dosimetric models, and improved dose-response 
information. 
<P><B>Improvements in Risk Assessment or Risk Management:</B> To support 
Improvements in Risk Assessment or Risk Management, this Center will serve as a 
significant regional and national resource that will generate important new
