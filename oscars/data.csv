[NOTE: Early in 1956, the name of blacklisted screenwriter Michael Wilson had been deleted from the screen credits of Friendly Persuasion by Allied Artists, the film's distributor, based on a 1952 agreement between the Screen Writers Guild and various production companies.  That agreement gave studios the right to omit from the screen the name of any individual who had failed to clear himself before a duly constituted legislative committee of Congress if accused of Communist affiliations, as was the case with Wilson at the time.  The Academy, in the awkward position of possibly conferring its highest honor on someone whose name had been omitted from screen credit, revised its bylaws at a special February 6, 1957, meeting.  That revision, in essence, allowed that in such cases, the achievement itself could be eligible for nomination, but the specific writer would be ineligible.  The following instructions were sent to Price Waterhouse & Co., Certified Public Accountants, who tabulated Academy ballots:  ""...we ask that if, in tabulating the nominations ballots for Best Screenplay (adapted), Friendly Persuasion is one of the five nominations, you list the other four alphabetically by title and below: Friendly Persuasion - Achievement nominated, but writer ineligible for Award under Academy By-Laws.""  On February 17, 1957, the Academy's Board of Governors voted to instruct Price Waterhouse & Co. ""...to list five nominations, and in the event that one of these is declared ineligible under the By-Law provision, four nominations would appear on the final ballot.""  THIS NOMINATION WAS NOT INCLUDED ON THE FINAL BALLOT.  (The bylaw was repealed by the Academy as ""unworkable"" on January 12, 1959.)  On December 10, 2002, the Academy's Board of Governors voted to reinstate Mr. Wilson's nomination.]"

The credits from the film listed four Directors of Photography (in the following order), Mr. Persin, Mr. Wottitz, Pierre Levent and Mr. Bourgoin.  The program for the Awards ceremony and even the official letter from Price Waterhouse with the results of the final voting for the awards listed the three names as winners in this category.  At some point, the name of Henri Persin was dropped from the nomination, as his name has been ""whited-out"" from the official wording for the nomination certificates, and the nominations and winners lists the Academy publishes do not include his name.   The Academy's records and files give no reason for this exclusion.]"
