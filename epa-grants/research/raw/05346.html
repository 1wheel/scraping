        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <P>Sediment cores are useful tools in reconstructing the history of aquatic 
ecosystems. Many parameters, stresses and responses at the time of sediment 
deposition cause specific signals in a core. The USGS raised some very deep 
cores (115m long, representing 450,000 years) during the 1970s and 80s for work 
on the long time scale, and the UC Davis Mercury Project raised some shallow 
cores (~1m, representing 50-75 years) during 1992 to investigate changes in 
sediment Hg since the last mining episode. We are now interested in cores of 2-3 
meters length, which will reflect the last 250-350 years of changes in the lake 
in order to assess the kinds of natural and anthropogenic stresses applied since 
the advent of European colonization. In collaboration with several other 
subprojects, we are also investigating the documentary history available to 
reconstruct stress events and responses. A combination of cores and standard 
historical analysis, together with process-oriented investigations, should 
result in an excellent reconstruction of past stresses and their effects.
<P>For the past ten months we have been designing a sampling protocol and 
methodology and gathering historical information for the Clear Lake ecosystem. 
Because Clear Lake is relatively shallow, we have been able to design a simple 
hand-driven coring device that allows us to sample the whole historical sequence 
well back into the pre-European period. These cores will be dated (210Pb) and 
analyzed for a large number of parameters (x-ray, nutrients, Hg, diatoms, 
pollen, algal pigments, etc.). This will allow us to reconstruct the effects of 
major events in the basin (i.e. dam construction, logging, road building, stream 
channel disturbance, mining activities, residential development, etc.) on the 
physical and biological responses that can be detected in cores, such as 
sediment rate and planktonic community composition. The methodology is in place, 
some preliminary cores have been raised and used to work out the problems of 
sampling and analysis, and the historical research has been started. During the 
next year, we will raise six cores from Clear Lake and have them analyzed for 
the different parameters. There will be two cores raised from each of the three 
basins of the lake. By doing this, we can test how deposition has changed, both 
within the basins and between the basins.Previous research has shown that Lake Tahoe, which is in the earliest stage 
of eutrophication, has made a fundamental switch from a classically N-limited 
system to one that is increasingly sensitive to P. Studies by the Tahoe Research 
Group (TRG), directed by Dr. Goldman, and including Drs. Reuter and Jassby, 
indicate that the shift in lake nutrient limitation from N to P can be 
attributed to atmospheric N deposition from both in-basin and out-of-basin N 
sources. Most of the P entering the lake ultimately comes from the watershed, as 
has been shown by extensive monitoring data collected in conjunction with the 
TRG's Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program. P loading from the Tahoe 
watershed is the current focus of this project.
<P>Graduate student Lorin Hatch is currently nearing completion of his Ph.D. 
thesis research on the generation and transport of P in the Lake Tahoe 
ecosystem, with particular emphasis on biologically available P to lake 
phytoplankton. Research in the last year has examined the temporal and spatial 
variability of P in ten Tahoe streams, with the most intensive work on two 
streams that are located in a fragile but urban-stressed area of the basin. Mr. 
Hatch has been conducting 24-hour studies on these two creeks, once a month over 
the course of the snowmelt season. A publication is currently being prepared, 
and results were presented at the North American Lake Management Society annual 
meeting in Toronto (November 6-10, 1995). Mr. Hatch has also been assembling a 
15-year data set on discharge, P, and suspended sediment data collected for the 
Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program. Preliminary results were presented at 
the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography annual meeting in Reno, NV 
(June 1995) and more intensive analysis is currently under way.
<P>Ongoing urbanization in the Tahoe basin is disturbing the fragile soils, 
increasing the erosion and delivery of P-rich sediments to the lake. Soils of 
nine major watersheds in the Tahoe basin have been analyzed for several P 
fractions in order to determine the actual P bioavailability associated with 
potential yield from various land-use practices. Mr. Hatch will address the 
subject of urban stress on the Tahoe ecosystem this coming year with the results 
of his intensive stream and lake analysis. Stream water samples from both above 
and below areas of human development will serve as nutrient spikes to lake water 
bioassay experiments, determining more precisely how land disturbance has 
enhanced the ongoing eutrophication of Lake Tahoe. This information will be 
combined with land classification parameters such as bioavailable P will enter 
the lake from various types of land disturbance.
<P>Our goal is to incorporate a P yield potential into an improved land 
classification scheme. This should make it possible to incorporate P input into 
a geographical information system to yield important management directions so 
that remedial work on the watershed can most effectively address the problem of 
nutrient stress on the fragile Tahoe ecosystem as well as other lakes.<P>Sediment cores are useful tools in reconstructing the history of aquatic

Electron acceptor interactions between chlorophenols and their dechlorinated metabolites and interactions between chlorophenols and sulfate are examined.<P>Authority to establish HSRC Center Program was established by EPA in 1989 
under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986. The mission of 
the program was to conduct research to develop and demonstrate new methods to 
assess and remediate sites contaminated with hazardous substances; improve 
existing treatment technologies; decrease the production &amp; use of hazardous 
substances; and educate hazardous substance management professionals and improve 
community public awareness</P>
<P>The HSRC program provided a national program of basic and applied research, 
technology transfer, and training. Five multi-university centers, each located 
in a pair of federal regions, focused on different aspects of hazardous 
substance management. They brought together researchers from a variety of 
disciplines to collaborate on integrated research projects. </P>
<P>The HSRCs were funded by EPA, DOE, DOD, academia, and other state and federal 
government agencies. The centers shaped their research agendas with the 
assistance of advisory committees made up of representatives from industry, 
regulatory organizations, academic institutions, and government.
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Approach:</h3>
        <P>The Western Region center covered EPA Regions 9 and 10, and is led by Stanford University, with Oregon State University participating. This HSRC focused on groundwater cleanup and site remediation with a strong emphasis on biological approaches. Projects addressed chlorinated solvents; halogenated aromatics (pentachlorophenol and PCBs); nonhalogenated aromatics including petroleum derivatives; ordinance wastes (TNT); heavy metals; and transport and fate.
