        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>The University of Washington Center for Child Environmental Health Risks Research (CHC) was established in 1998. The theme of the Center is understanding the biochemical, molecular and exposure mechanisms that define children's susceptibility to pesticides and the implications for assessing pesticide risks to normal development and learning. The CHC is a multi-disciplinary research program that conducts basic and applied mechanistic research aimed at reducing the adverse effects of environmental pesticide exposures in children. The Center&rsquo;s research program includes basic mechanistic studies of toxicity, exposure assessment, risk assessment, and community based participatory research. Researchers from the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center work in the lab, in the field and in the community to bring a unique and successful approach to the study of children&rsquo;s environmental health. It is administratively housed within the Institute for Risk Analysis and Risk Communication that is in the UW's School of Public Health and Community Medicine.</p>

<p>To facilitate both basic and applied research on reducing the adverse effects of environmental pesticide exposures, center participants include members from multiple institutions, schools, and varied departments and clinics. To achieve tangible effects on the community, the CHC includes a partnership with an eastern Washington community within the Yakima Valley agricultural center of our state, to jointly accomplish pesticide intervention with reduced childhood pesticide exposures.</p>

<p>The <strong>six specific objectives</strong> of our Center are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To identify cellular, biochemical and molecular mechanisms for the adverse developmental neurotoxicity of pesticides.</li>
	<li>To identify susceptibility factors for developmental neurotoxicity of pesticides, including genetic polymorphisms.</li>
	<li>To improve our understanding of critical pathways of pesticide exposure for children.</li>
	<li>To intervene to reduce children&rsquo;s exposure to pesticides, including the development of a culturally-appropriate intervention to break the take-home pathway.</li>
	<li>To provide core support for the development and application of risk assessment methods. This will enable basic research on pesticide toxicity and exposure to be translated for improved child health by informing risk decisions to protect children&rsquo;s health from pesticides.</li>
	<li>To foster partnerships between academic researchers and the community in which information requested by the community and basic research deficiencies/gaps are translated into studies that address the health needs of both.</li>
</ul>
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Approach:</h3>
        <p>The CHC is comprised of two laboratory based research projects, two field based projects, and four facility cores. The four facility cores (Neurobehavioral Assessment, Exposure Assessment, Risk Characterization and Risk Communication) are designed to support the research agenda and to put the research into a child specific risk assessment context. Thus the scientific findings on pesticide toxicity and exposure can be directly incorporated into risk assessment models that are designed to protect child health. </p>

<p><strong><u>Highlights of Research Projects:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Molecular Mechanisms of Pesticide Induced Developmental Neurotoxicity</strong></p>
<p>The Molecular Mechanisms Research Project specifically evaluates the molecular and cellular mechanisms of toxicity through which pesticides can exert their neurodevelopmental toxicity. Alterations in the regulatory dynamics of neural cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death are examined. </p>

<p>We are investigating two of the most commonly used organophosphate pesticides - chlorpyrifos and diazinon, as well as persistent pesticides that were used historically. We focus on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of toxicity during &ldquo;windows of susceptibility,&rdquo; the periods during which these pesticides can cause neurodevelopmental toxicity and disease. A systems biology based assessment integrates <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> studies (as well as toxicogenomic assessments) across endpoints and functional outcomes using Physiologically Based Toxicokinetic (PBTK) and Biologically Based Dose Response (BBDR) models. This approach allows for evaluation of the mechanisms of action including gene environment interactions on cell cycle regulation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Neurodevelopmental models for normal as well as toxicant perturbed neocortical development (including neurogenesis and synaptogenesis) have been created. The systems biology approach that our center employs, and links with neurobehavioral function, leads to an integrated understanding of the critical pesticide exposures associated with neurodevelopmental toxicity. </p>

<p><strong>Genetic Susceptibility to Pesticides</strong></p>
<p>The Genetic Susceptibility Research Project examines gene/environment interactions important for children&rsquo;s health by evaluating differences in genetics that affect metabolism and define susceptibility. The overall aim of this research project is to investigate the developmental neurotoxicity of the organophosphates chlorpyrifos oxon and diazoxon, and to determine the role of genetic variability in the polymorphic serum enzyme paraoxonase (PON1) in protecting against developmental neurotoxicity.</p>

<p>Recent studies in humans (run in collaboration with the UC-Berkeley CHAMACOS) have shown that developmental onset of PON1 is highly variable among children. It can appear at ages as early as four months and as late as two years. Inter-individual variability in PON1192 genotype, PON-1 levels and development time course means that children can have different susceptibilities to adverse effects of pesticides. The contribution of PON1 to pesticide toxicity has had profound effects for understanding human health and now its role in defining children&rsquo;s susceptibility is under investigation.</p>

<p><strong>Community-Based Participatory Research Project</strong></p>
<p>The overall goal of the Community Based Participatory Research Project (CBPR) is to investigate multiple pathways that may contribute to pesticide exposure in adults and children living in agricultural communities.</p>

<p>The community-based research project has evaluated the impacts of the occupational take home pathway on pesticide exposure in children of farmworkers. Concentrations of OP pesticide metabolites in the urine of farmworkers and their children were correlated with concentrations of OP pesticide residues in vehicle and house dust. Concentrations were higher in households with an adult who worked in apple and/or pear orchards. Consistent with our findings, these fruit crops had the highest amounts of OP pesticides applied per acre. In addition, the Center is collecting longitudinal data to gain an understanding of the effects of within person variability versus between person variability to better identify an exposed cohort within a population by using a limited number of bioassays.</p>

<p><strong>Pesticide Spray Drift Study</strong></p>
<p>The overall objective of this project is to understand the underlying physical and behavioral mechanisms by which non-occupational exposure occurs following pesticide applications. </p>

<p>One study measured airborne concentrations of pesticides in a community during and after a spray event. The study investigated assumptions that are made to ensure the safe application of pesticides. Results revealed that the existing volatilization model under-predicted (by about 4 fold) the measured pesticide concentration after the spray event when temperatures rose significantly. This indicates a need to re-examine inhalation exposures for pesticides when the temperature is high. Further, when linked with our study examining children&rsquo;s activity profiles, the spray drift study suggests a need to re-evaluate transport modeling and exposure factors. </p>

<p><strong>Important research findings from the UW Center:</strong></p>
<p><em>Contributions of occupational factors to home contamination -- Evidence of Take-home Pathway</em></p>
<ol>
 <li>Higher concentrations of OP pesticide dimethyl metabolites in the urine of farmworkers and their children were correlated with higher concentrations of azinphos-methyl pesticide residue in vehicle and house dust.</li>
 <li>Children of orchard workers have an additional source of pesticide exposure through pesticides that are transported on the clothing, boots and skin of their farmworker parents.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Contributions of occupational factors to home contamination -- Evidence of Crop-associated Exposure</em></p>
<ol>
 <li>Concentrations of OP pesticide dimethyl metabolites in the urine of farmworkers and their children and concentrations of azinphos-methyl pesticide residue in vehicle and house dust were higher among farmworker households employed in the pome fruit crops.</li>
 <li>Consistent with these findings, the pome fruit crops of apples and pears had the highest amounts of OP pesticides applied per acre, in particular azinphos-methyl.</li>
 <li>After controlling for crop, we did not detect differences in exposure between farmworkers performing varying job tasks.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Exposure Assessment Study</em></p>
<ol>
 <li>Analyzed three longitudinal studies of OP metabolites (WA, MN, and MD) and estimated within and between person variability.</li>
 <li>Within child variation larger than between child variations.</li>
 <li>Large within child variability for OP pesticide biomarkers limits ability to identify exposed populations.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>PON1 Status of farmworker mothers and children</em></p>
<p><em>(Study conducted in collaboration with UC-Berkeley CHAMACOS)</em></p>
<ol>
 <li>8 &ndash; 10-fold variability in sensitivity to CPO between groups of mothers and their newborns.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Production of &lsquo;Humanized&rsquo; Transgenic Mouse Lines Carrying hPON1Q192 or hPON1R192 in Place of Mouse PON1</em></p>
<ol>
 <li>PON1Q192 mice were twice as sensitive as PON1R192 mice to brain ChE inhibition by chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO).</li>
 <li>PON1Q192 mice were more sensitive than PON1R192 mice to neocortical histopathology resulting from chronic developmental exposure to low doses (0.18-0.25 mg/kg/d) of CPO.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Washington Pesticide Spray Drift Study </em></p>
<ol>
 <li>A new method of using small backpacks equipped with GPS for tracking children&rsquo;s movements was developed to better understand children&rsquo;s movements throughout the day. </li>
 <li>An innovative laser-based system (LIDAR) of real-time measurement of drift during pesticide-spraying was developed. Observations made with this system have resulted in a reassessment of methods to estimate exposures from pesticide drift currently used at the EPA.</li>
