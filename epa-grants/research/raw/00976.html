        <h3>Description:</h3>
      	Children are the most susceptible population to environmental contaminants 
since: (a) their organs and neurological system are rapidly developing; (b) 
their intake (air, water, food, beverage) is greater relative to body size and 
weight; (c) their activities, behavior and proximity to the surfaces enhance 
their potential contact with toxic substances. The NHEXAS and Border Surveys of 
Arizona document multimedia, multi-pathway exposures in Arizona across the 
population as determined using a population based probability design. 
Preliminary results from Yuma County suggest enhanced exposure to pesticides, 
lead and manganese. Local agriculture, secondary exposure to those 
occupationally exposed, suboptimal housing stock, and reduced body coverage by 
clothing to combat the heat, are factors that may enhance exposure to OP 
pesticides and some metals. Our goal is the accurate determination of the routes 
and amounts of exposure experienced by young children. We will measure rates of 
dermal contact, hand to mouth, and mouthing activity, among children using video 
tape methods. We will evaluate media contacted by children (air, house dust, 
hands) for concentrations of 9 OP pesticides commonly used in the area 
(including chlorpyrifos, diazinon and malathion). Lead, manganese and other 
metals will be measured in house dust by XRF. We will test the null hypotheses 
that (1) frequent intermittent contact with contaminated surfaces is not 
associated with elevated urinary metabolite yield, (2) contaminant levels found 
in the handled food of children will not differ from that of unhandled food (as 
determined by NHEXAS, Border and Children's Pesticide Surveys); (3) exposure 
through intermittent contact will not significantly increase the total exposure 
for children. (4) No differences in hand to mouth activity will be evident in a 
subset of children evaluated longitudinally within I year. A Quality Assurance 
Project Plan will be developed prior to entering the field and implemented 
throughout the project Testing these hypotheses will be approached using a 
nested study design of potty trained children 2.5-3.9 years of age. The 
population will be recruited through local clinics, Head Start, and WIC 
programs. We expect over 90% of the population to be low SES Hispanics 
consistent with local census results. Phase]: Urine will be collected from 210 
children and an OP screen will evaluate metabolites. Two groups of children (n = 
30 each) will be selected using this screen. One group will reflect elevated 
urinary metabolites to OPs; the other low. Groups will be matched by age, 
gender, ethnicity, day-care status and proximity of households to fields. Phase 
2: A multimedia, multipathway, and behavioral assessment will be made of the 
children and their environments. Indoor air, carpet dust, and dermal surfaces 
will be evaluated for pesticide concentrations. Questionnaires previously used 
in the NHEYAS, Border and Children's Pesticide Survey will be administered for 
comparison. Additional questions and observations will be asked regarding the 
child's mouthing and hand to mouth contact. Step 3: Concurrent with 
environmental sampling, each child will be video taped for 16 (waking) hours 
over the course of two days. Duration of intermittent contacts with various 
surfaces by each hand and the mouth will be measured for duration and summed 
over the da. Dermal collections will be made to correspond with the videotaping 
periods. A second urine assay for specific pesticide metabolites will be 
evaluated in conjunction with the assessment of environmental media. Ten 
children each from Group I and Group 2 will be reevaluated after I year. 
<P><B>Data analysis:</B> Univariate and summary statistical analysis and 
hypothesis testing will be performed using SPSS to evaluate the distributions of 
the variables and contact classes. Distributions of measures within the two 
groups and across previous studies will be statistically compared and modeled 
using parametric and non-parametric statistics. Further, exposure models 
developed for the NHEXAS, Border and Children's pesticide surveys will be used 
with these data for the population as a whole (n 60) and each group separately. 
Missing variables will be estimated form NHEXAS, Border, and Children's 
pesticide databases when appropriate. Modeled results will be compared and the 
impact of the revised exposure constants evaluated.
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Expected Results:</h3>
        We expect to find (1) elevated urinary metabolites indicative of OP exposure 
among children with (a) elevated contact with surfaces, (b) greater hand to 
mouth activity, and (c) frequent mouthing behavior. The relationship is probably 
exponential. (2) We expect a wide range of intermittent contact behavior among 
children and we expect the difference to be quantifiable among the 2 groups 
(case and control). (3) We expect exposure to decline as the children of both 
groups age. Exposure between the groups will begin to converge with time. (4) We 
expect to reduce children's exposures through education of parents, decision 
makers and health educators. 
<P><B>Improvements in Risk Assessment and Risk Management:</B> Current exposure 
factors for children appear based on unvalidated sub ective reports. We believe 
they grossly under represent the amount of contaminant ingested and dermally 
absorbed by children. Experimentally derived factors could only enhance exposure 
assessment models. Further, this case control approach will help identify 
factors that minimize exposure. If the expected trends materialize, mitigation 
recommendations could be made to health educators, policy makers and parents.
