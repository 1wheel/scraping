        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>The goal of Program Area 5 is to transfer technical information produced by CATM concerning trace metals to interested parties in research organizations and throughout the energy and environmental industry, as well as to provide training and educational opportunities for both students and professionals. Additionally, as products are developed and demonstrated through CATM, partnerships will be developed leading to commercialized technologies.
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Approach:</h3>
        <p>In order to facilitate the sharing of information, several programs and 
meetings involving industry, government, research organizations, and the general 
public have been planned. In addition, educational institutes have been targeted 
to provide education on environmental issues, including pollution prevention and 
control technologies. Initially, efforts have focused on local education 
programs and on improving the curriculum at UND.</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Progress</EM></STRONG></P>
<P>The fourth annual CATM meeting was held at the EERC in September 1997. The 
purpose of the meeting was to provide a forum by which industry, government, and 
the research community could exchange information on air toxic metals and 
provide direction for CATM's research, development, and commercialization 
programs. Approximately 60 people participated, representing the government 
(including EPA, DOE, MPCA, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, USGS, 
and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality), industry, and academic 
research organizations. Highlights of the meeting included a presentation by 
Martha Keating of the EPA on the status of the "Mercury Report to Congress" and 
a panel discussion entitled "Mercury Regulations - What Are the Options?" One of 
the major results of the discussion was the recognition that no cost-effective 
control technologies are currently available for utility applications to control 
elemental Hg.</P>
<P>The Science Advisory Committee (SAC) was restructured during the past year 
and is now one of two committees making up the Research Advisory Council (RAC). 
The other committee, the Partners Advisory Committee (PAC), has a representative 
from each of the current Affiliate members and a member from EPA. In December 
1996, a draft Request for Ideas was sent to the PAC members for their input 
regarding research needs in the area of air toxic metals. Based on this input 
and input from other staff at the EERC, ten preproposals were mailed to the SAC 
in March 1997 for their technical review. Written comments and suggestions were 
returned to the CATM Director and Associate Director for preparation of the CATM 
1997 program. A second meeting was held in conjunction with the fourth annual 
CATM meeting at the EERC in September 1997. At this meeting, the EPA Program 
Officer, PAC members, and CATM staff discussed CATM's future direction and 
identified and prioritized research needs. The EERC's newly hired Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) Officer was also introduced and gave a short 
presentation on the direction of the QA/QC Program at the EERC and how it 
addresses CATM requirements. </P>
<P>The Affiliates Program has been well received and has generated significant 
interest by several sponsors. To date, EPRI, Otter Tail Power Company, Northern 
States Power Company (NSP), Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), and the NDIC are 
official Affiliate Program members.</P>
<P>Part of the mission of CATM involves contributing to improved environmental 
education opportunities for students at UND. As a step toward that goal, CATM 
provided funding for UND faculty to develop stronger environmental education 
components in their courses. Two courses were selected for funding through a 
competitive review process. Dr. Theron Nelson of UND's Department of Finance is 
continuing the process of establishing an Environmental Issues minor for 
students throughout the College of Business and Public Administration (CBPA). 
Final approval by the CBPA's Curriculum Committee is pending. Dr. Douglas Ludlow 
of the UND Department of Chemical Engineering has incorporated pollution 
prevention and remediation issues into a freshman-level chemical engineering 
course. Both of these programs have or are expected to reach a large number of 
undergraduate students.</P>
<P>In September 1997, the EERC's volunteer Environmental Education Committee 
(EEC) teamed with the EERC's Red River Water Management Consortium (RRWMC), 
CATM, the city of Grand Forks, and additional volunteers to kick off the Storm 
Drain Stenciling Project. Storm drain stenciling is a simple and economical way 
to promote environmental education by teaching citizens that storm drains 
generally flow to the nearest river, lake, or stream without any treatment. 
Decreasing and eventually eliminating waste disposal directly or indirectly into 
storm drains is a way to prevent a major source of water pollution. The program 
consisted of volunteers using a 17- by 11 -inch stencil to paint a pollution 
prevention message next to street drains throughout the city: "DUMP NO WASTE - 
DRAINS TO RIVER," accompanied by the image of a fish. Volunteers also handed out 
informational flyers to the public that provide practical, easy- to-implement 
solutions to several stormwater pollution problems, such as disposal of motor 
oil, cleaning solvents, paint and paint thinner, gasoline, antifreeze, plastics, 
and yard waste.</P>
<P>Two issues of the CATM Newsletter were published and distributed to industry 
and other interested parties. The newsletter is circulated within all states of 
the United States and to over 40 countries internationally. The newsletter is 
designed to inform interested parties of air toxic issues and CATM activities 
and to encourage further participation and collaboration among industry and 
government. The newsletter is also available through the EERC's home page on the 
World Wide Web at <A 
href="http://www.eerc.und.nodak.edu">www.eerc.und.nodak.edu</A>.</P>
<P>In February 1997, the EEC conducted its fourth annual waste audit. The audit 
involved taking inventory of 2 days' worth of garbage generated at the EERC and 
sorting the waste into recyclable and nonrecyclable categories. The results were 
compared with the findings of the first three waste audits and showed that only 
34% of EERC's garbage is recyclable material, an all- time low in our waste 
audit history. This indicates that EERC employees are making good use of the 
recyclable collection bins placed throughout the work areas for white and mixed 
paper, cans, #l and #2 plastic bottles, and glass. Total daily output continues 
to hover around half a pound per person for the third year in a row. </P>
<P><STRONG>CATM Short Course</STRONG></P>
<P>A practical, l-day short course on air toxic metals entitled "Trace Metals in 
Industrial Applications" was developed and presented to industry. The goal of 
the short course is to provide an overview of trace metal behavior and control 
in systems utilizing coal, oil, and natural gas or alternative fuels such as 
biomass, municipal solid waste, and RDFs. The course covers topic areas such as 
trace elements in fuels, sampling and analysis, trace element transformations 
and partitioning, control technologies, prediction and modeling, ash 
by-products, and a regulatory overview. The knowledge learned can assist in the 
design of new systems or the retrofit of existing units, can aid in the 
selection of coals and fuels for power generation, or can guide the blending of 
fuels to meet regulatory constraints.</P>
<P>The physical and chemical characteristics of all types of fuels are addressed 
in light of trace element content. The sampling and analysis sections cover the 
use of various standard and advanced techniques, the latest research in the 
development of methods, and the problems associated with determining trace 
element concentrations and emissions in power-generating facilities. Trace 
element transformations and partitioning during combustion and postcombustion 
processes are complex. This short course addresses the components involved, 
transformation types, and various approaches to studying transformations and 
partitioning. Control technologies, both conventional and advanced, are 
addressed in relation to the latest DOE comprehensive report on HAPs. A section 
on predictive methods relates alternative methods to evaluate the fate and 
emission of trace elements in a given system and fuel type. Fuel conversion ash 
by-products of all types are addressed in relation to trace elements. The 
various types of ash material, the trace metal distribution, and methods of 
evaluating trace metal mobility of ash by-products are described. The regulatory 
section is an overview of the events leading up to and a discussion of the 
present regulatory situation.
        <p></p>
      
        <h3>Rationale:</h3>
        <p>Because of the time line that Congress has imposed on EPA, training, education, and dissemination of up-to-date information to industry and government agencies (EPA, DOE) in a timely manner are critical. Sharing and transferring the latest research findings to industry and EPA will greatly assist in establishing scientifically based regulatory standards.
